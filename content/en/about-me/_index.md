</div></div>  

I have been directing bridge tournaments since 2021. 

See the [tournaments](/en/tournaments) section for a list of national tournaments in Czechia, where I took part as a TD, and
the [tournaments in the Prague bridge club](/en/bkp-tournaments) section for a list of tournaments in the Prague bridge club, which I directed or took part in.


## HABRA - where I grew up

[HABRA - the HAvířov BRidge Academy](https://bridzhavirov.cz) - is a bridge club in Havířov, Czechia, where I grew up and learned to play bridge.

I would very much like to express my deep gratitude to people who run it there, especially to my first bridge teacher, Mgr. Jarda Hájek, and my subsequent teachers, colleagues and partners, Daniel Vachtarčík, Soňa Hájková, and Petr Pszczolka.
